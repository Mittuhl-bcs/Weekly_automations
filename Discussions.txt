Sequence:
- Pull the data through the query
- filter the data for each of the table 
- compute the pivot table / modified groupby
    - apply filters on 2 of the pivot tables 
- organize it on summary page

- Save the pivot data
- develop a mailer - add the data as a table
- Send it with attached file


Doubts:
- location id in IR
- Pivot tables in different pages


- all the data for transfers
- Inventory returns
- distinct count
- filter out the data that has recieved date - partially recived
- formatting - rounds with commas
